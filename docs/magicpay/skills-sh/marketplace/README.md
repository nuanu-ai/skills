# Install MagicPay for General Agent

Install the MagicPay skill from the runtime marketplace or public skills repository.

## Install

2. Connect the remote MagicPay MCP for this runtime.
3. Confirm get_magicpay_capabilities reports client_browser mode.

Supported skill directories:

- .agents/skills/

## Browser architecture

The runtime built-in browser is the only page-control owner. It navigates,
analyzes, fills ordinary fields, chooses exact protected targets, and
interprets results, and owns the one final commitment. Do not install or
start a second browser controller.
